## How it works

This script takes the length of every video, calculates the total duration, and gives you back what you need.

If you find yourself doing this often, you can always use a tool like Tampermonkey.
That way, whenever you want to know the total duration of a playlist, it will be as easy as opening the console in Dev Tools.

### Regular script

1. Copy the code of either of the following files:
    * yt-playlist-duration-**script**.js
    * yt-playlist-duration-**script-min**.js
2. Go to a YouTube Playlist
3. Open the Dev Tools (F12)
4. Open the Console tab
5. Paste the code and press enter
6. The playlist's duration will be logged in the console

### Userscript
1. Copy the code of the following file:
    * yt-playlist-duration-**userscript**.js
2. Go to Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey and paste the script
3. Save the script and activate it
4. Go to a YouTube Playlist
5. Open the Dev Tools (F12)
6. Open the Console tab
7. The playlist's duration will be logged in the console (if necessary, refresh the page)
